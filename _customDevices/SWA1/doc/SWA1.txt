SWA1 WiFi Smart Socket
======================

--------------
Prepare device
--------------

Use sharp 3 mm flat head screw driver to open the case. There is a nose
protruding from the upper part of the case in the middle of the bottom
edge. Be careful not to break it. Fiddle around with the nose and the
plug falls apart.

The 230V board is loose. The WiFi board with LEDs and momentary switch is
screwed to the top of the case. Unscrew the WiFi board and solder a 5-pin
header to the back of the board. The pin header fits nicely between the relay
and the other components on the 230V board.

You might also just stick the pin header into the holes, tilt it and hold it
in place.

-----------------
Original firmware
-----------------

To monitor the boot messages of the original firmware, connect serial a
USB/Serial adapter as follows (see SWA1-Pinning.pdf):

SWA1    Adapter
-------------------
RxD     TxD   green
TxD     RxD   white
GND     GND   black
GPIO0   nc
5V      5V    red

Set serial console speed to 74480 baud.

Boot message from original firmware (between dotted lines):

Other devices give SPI Mode QIO instead of DOUT.

Flashing OmniESP
----------------

See general documentation how to choose the OmniESP firmware for the SWA1
WiFi Smart Socket from the set of prepackaged firmwares.

1. Set build_flags in [env:d1_mini] section of platformio.ini as follows:

build_flags = -Wl,-Teagle.flash.2m.ld

Then build firmware.

2. Connect USB/Serial/Adapter:

SWA1    Adapter
-------------------
RxD     TxD   green
TxD     RxD   white
GND     GND   black
GPIO0   GND
5V      5V    red

GPIO0 must be held low on device startup to enter bootloader mode for flashing
firmware and SPIFFS. Wire RxD, TxD, GND and GPIO0, the connect 5V last to
power up the device and enter bootloader mode. Sometimes, powering up does not
set the bootloader mode. Then just try again. I usually works after a few
tries.

3. Flash OmniESP firmware.

4. Disconnect and reconnect 5V to enter bootloader mode once again.

5. Flash SPIFFS

6. Remove GND from GPIO, disconnect and reconnect 5V to boot the
device and watch the OmniESP boot messages on your serial console.

7. You are done.

If flashing fails, user lower baud rate in platformio.ini, e.g. use
upload_speed = 115200 instead of upload_speed = 921600.
